      <h3>National Cyber League</h3>
	<p>The National Cyber League (NCL, <a href="http://www.nationalcyberleague.org/index.shtml">http://www.nationalcyberleage.org</a>) was founded in May 2011 to provide an ongoing virtual training ground for collegiate students to develop, practice, and validate their cybersecurity skills. Using lab exercises designed around industry-recognized performance-based exam objectives and aligned with individual and team games, the NCL is a first-of-its-kind ongoing experiment in learning and gaming using next-generation high-fidelity simulation environments.</p>
	<br>
	<ul>
	  <li><b>2013: </b>WVU finished 4th in the eastern conference and 11th nationally. The WVU team consisted of all undergraduates ranging from freshman to senior.

	    Of the 16 WVU students that competed, 7 broke the top 100 student in the nationwide-silver bracket for individuals. (Connor Anderson, Alan Fluder, Kyle Frank,Barry Martin, Zachary Prithchard, Mark Swisher, and Guytano Vignoli).
	    Additionally, Barry Martin ranked 1st nationally in the silver bracket. </li><br>

	  <li><b>2012: </b>
	    We were 10th in our conference The Spring 2012 Season of NCL. We also had a strong performance in the Fall 2012 NCL Season, with multiple team members in the top 25% of competitors</li>
	  <p>
	  </ul>  
	<h3>Mid-Atlantic Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition</h3>
	  <p> The Mid-Atlantic Collegiate Cyber Defense  Competition (MACCDC, <a href="http://maccdc.org">http://maccdc.org</a>) started in 2006. MACCDC is a "inherit and defend" competition. In a nutshell, a group of 8 students are asked to take over a pre configured network. The network often simulates common business configurations in design and aims to be as life like as possible. When the students inherit the network, they then have to fend off waves off hackers known as the Red Team. Additionally, while all of this is going on, injects are given, which basically come down to basic business task that must be completed, all of which are time sensitive. 
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><b>2014: </b>WVU placed in the top 3 in the MACCDC virtual qualifer among 30+ schools. WVU then competed against 7 others at the 2014 MACCDC Regional Competition. </li><br>
	    <li><b>2013: </b>2012 was the first year WVU took part in this competition. WVU took 2nd in their respected qualifying round division and 7th in the 2012 Mid-Atlantic Regional Finals at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.
